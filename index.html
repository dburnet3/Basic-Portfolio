                <p><b>Hobbies:</b> Indulging in the ever so entertaining programming on Bravo! She also enjoys
                    cooking and reads cookbooks for fun.

                    First thing she does in the morning: Takes a breath, because most days might be challenging
                    but if she remembers to breathe first she's reminded that intentional behavior should
                    be executed throughout the day!</p>

                <p><b>Favorite US City:</b> Atlanta, GA
                    <b>Favorite Concert:</b> Brian McKnight. Denise believes that she should've been born in the late
                    80's
                    so that she could fully experience the 90's like her older sister!</p>
                <p><b>Professional Background:</b> With 5 years of project management experience Denise has lead
                    software
                    development projects ranging from $120k - $2M
                    using Waterfall and Agile Methodologies. Her experience in both the public and private sectors has
                    equipped her to support
                    larger programs in various organizational structures.
